							What is Javascript
						</header>
						<p>
							JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages
							interactive (e.g. having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There
							are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.Js
							which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such
							as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for
							example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects
							of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
						</p>
						<p>
							JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core
							set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core
							JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it
							with additional objects; for example:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a
								browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow
								an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such
								as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
							</li>
							<li>
								Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to
								running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application
								to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation
								to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
							</li>

							Java and Javascript
						</header>
						<p>
							JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
							JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type
							checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
							and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
							JavaScript.
						</p>
						<p>
							In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript
							supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
							Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead
							of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
							inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
							supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions
							can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
						</p>
						<p>
							JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
							variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are
							public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
							Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
						</p>
						<p>
							Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type
							safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or
							access private memory by corrupting Java bytecodes. Java's class-based
							model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class
							inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These
							requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.
						</p>

					<section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
						<header class="title">Hello World</header>
						<p>
							To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello
							world" JavaScript code:
						</p>
						<code>
							function greetMe(yourName) {
							alert('Hello ' + yourName);
							}
							<br><br>
							greetMe('World');
						</code>
						<p>
							Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="main-section" id="Variables">
						<header class="title">Variables</header>
						<p>
							You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables,
							called identifiers, conform to certain rules. A JavaScript identifier must start with a
							letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also
							be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A"
							through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
						<header class="title">
							Declaring Variables
						</header>
						<p>
							You can declare a variable in two ways:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>With the keyword <code>var</code>. For example, <code>var x = 42</code>. This syntax can
								be used to declare both local and global variables, depending on the execution context.
							</li>
							<li>With the keyword <code>const</code> or <code>let</code>. For example, <code>let y =
									13</code>. This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable. See
								Variable scope below.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
						<header class="title">
							Variable Scope
						</header>
						<p>
							When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because
							it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable
							within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available
							only within that function.
						</p>
						<p>
							JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable
							declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides
							within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of
							x is the global context (or the function if the following codes are part of the function),
							not the immediate if statement block.
						</p>
						<code>
							if (true) {
							var x = 5;
							}
							<br> <br>
							console.log(x); // x is 5
						</code>
						<p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>

						<code>
							if (true) {
							let y = 5;
							}
							<br> <br>
							console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
						</code>
					</section>

					<br> <br>

					<section class="main-section" id="Global_Variables">
						<header class="title">
							Global Variables
						</header>
						<p>
							Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages, the global
							object is
							<code>window</code>, so you can set and access global variables using the
							<code>window.variable</code> syntax.
						</p>
						<p>
							Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one Consequently, you can access
							global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying
							the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called <code>phoneNumber</code> is
							declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
							parent.phoneNumber.window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
							frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document,
							you can refer to this variable from an iframe as <code>parent.phoneNumber</code>.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="main-section" id="Constants">
						<header class="title">
							Constants
						</header>
						<p>
							You can create a read-only, named constant with the <code>const</code> keyword. The syntax
							of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a
							letter, underscore or dollar sign ($) and can contain alphabetic,
							numeric, or underscore characters.
						</p>
						<code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
						<P>
							A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is
							running. It must be initialized to a value.
						</P>
						<P>
							The scope rules for constants are the same as those for <code>let</code> block-scope
							variables. If the
							<code>const</code> keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
						</P>
						<p>
							You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same
							scope. For example:
						</p>
						<code>
							// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
							<br> <br>
							function f() {};
							<br> <br>
							const f = 5;

							<br> <br> <br>
							// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR TOO
							<br> <br>
							function f() {
							const g = 5;
							var g;

							//statements
							}
						</code>
						<p>
							However, the properties of objects assigned to constants are not protected, so the following
							statement is executed without problems.
						</p>

						<code>
							const MY_OBJECT = {'key': 'value'};
							<br> <br>
							MY_OBJECT.key = 'otherValue';
						</code>
						<p>
							Also, the contents of an array are not protected, so the following statement is executed
							without problems.
						</p>
						<code>
							const MY_ARRAY = ['HTML','CSS'];
							<br> <br>
							MY_ARRAY.push('JAVASCRIPT');
							<br> <br>
							console.log(MY_ARRAY); //logs ['HTML','CSS','JAVASCRIPT'];
						</code>
					</section>
					<br> <br>

					<section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
						<header class="title">
							Data Types
						</header>
						<p>
							The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Seven data types that are primitives:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Boolean. <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
								<li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive,
									<code>null</code> is not the same as <code>Null</code>, <code>NULL</code>, or any
									other variant.</li>
								<li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.</li>
								<li>Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: <code>42</code> or
									<code>3.14159</code>.
								</li>
								<li>BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example:
									<code>9007199254740992n</code>.</li>
								<li>String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy"
								</li>
								<li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and
									immutable.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>and Object</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							Although these data types are relatively few, they enable you to perform useful functions
							with your applications.
							<code>Objects</code> and <code>functions</code> are the other fundamental elements in the
							language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
							procedures that your application can perform.
						</p>

					<section class="main-section" id="Block_Statement">
						<header class="title">
							Block Statement
						</header>
						<p>
							The most basic statement is a block statement that is used to group statements. The block is
							delimited by a pair of curly brackets:
						</p>
						<code>
							{
							statement_1;
							statement_2;
							.
							.
							.
							statement_n;
							}
